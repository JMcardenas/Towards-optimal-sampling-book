# Towards-optimal-sampling-book
This is a repository associated with the chapter book:

"Towards optimal sampling for learning sparse approximations in high dimensions" by Ben Adcock, Juan M. Cardenas, Nick Dexter and Sebastian Moraga 

to be published by Springer in late 2021.

# Code organization 
Files are organized into four main directories:

### src 
Contains the main Matlab files used to create figures in each chapter

Organized in chapters

### utils 
Contains various Matlab functions needed across main scripts

### data 
Contains .mat files generated by scripts in src

Organized in chapters

### Filenames

These generaically take the form 

fig_[chapt][number]_[row]_[col]
